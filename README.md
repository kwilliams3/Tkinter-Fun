# Tkinter-Fun
Python Project Involving Tkinter

This is a fun little project that I wanted to make using Python's Tkinter GUI package. This is my first Tkinter project, so the coding style might not be as graceful and elegant as it ought to be. Thanks for taking the time to read the README file!

DETAILS:
-creates a window that, in turn, can create more windows
-each new window will have either a red, white, or blue background color which is randomly chosen
