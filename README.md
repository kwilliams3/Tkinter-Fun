# Tkinter-Fun

Creates a window that, in turn, can create more windows
Each new window will have either a red, white, or blue background color - which is chosen randomly

This is a fun little project that I wanted to make using Python's Tkinter GUI package. This is my first Tkinter project, so the coding style might not be as graceful and elegant as it ought to be, but I'm still proud of it. =D
